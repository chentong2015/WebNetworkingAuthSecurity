TODO. REST: REPresentational State Transfer 定义资源映射的API架构和标准
REST is set of rules, the common standard for building web API
REST API defines resources which can map to system resources
URIs should only be used to identify the resources and not any action upon them uniquely

TODO. REST API 核心特征: URL链接(及其参数)本质是用于定位资源
1. Versioning of API
   - Support Backwards compatibility and migration
2. Stateless Communication
   - Client and Server don't need to store any information of each other
   - Every request/response is independent of all others
3. Resource is Noun, not verb
   - Url parameter is for locating Resource
   - Request url can't contain sensitive information
   - Request body will contain large object/json

RESTFul API Standards: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
