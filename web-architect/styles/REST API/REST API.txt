TODO. REST: REPresentational State Transfer
 一套API的架构和规则/标准, 用于定义资源的映射
REST is set of rules, the common standard for building web API
REST API defines resources which can map to system resources
URIs should only be used to identify the resources and not any action upon them uniquely

TODO. REST API 设计规范
https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/
1. Stateless Communication
   - Client and Server don't need to store any information of each other
   - Every request/response is independent of all others
2. API Endpoint returns a huge amount of data
   - Pagination: limit + offset -> server should assume default values
   - */products?limit=25&offset=50
3. Versioning of API
   - Support Backwards compatibility and migration
5. Resource is Noun, not verb
   - Url parameter is for locating Resource
   - Request url can't contain sensitive information
   - Request body will contain large object/json

TODO. RESTFull API 标准请求
RESTFull API follows the REST standards: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
