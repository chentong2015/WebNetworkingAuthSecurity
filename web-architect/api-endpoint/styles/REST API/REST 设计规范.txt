TODO. REST: REPresentational State Transfer
REST is set of rules, the common standard for building web API
REST API defines resources which can map to system resources
URIs should only be used to identify the resources and not any action upon them uniquely

RESTFull API follows the REST standards: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE

TODO. REST API设计规范  https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/
1. Stateless Communication
   - Client and Server don't need to store any information of each other
   - Every request/response is independent of all others
2. API Endpoint returns a huge amount of data
   - Pagination: limit + offset -> server should assume default values
   - */products?limit=25&offset=50
3. Versioning of API
   - Support Backwards compatibility and migration
5. Resource is Noun, not verb
   - Url parameter is for locating Resource
   - Request url can't contain sensitive information
   - Request body will contain large object/json

TODO. Spring Boot REST API 设计规范
1. 请求的类型 @RequestMapping @GetMapping
2. 认证和授权 @PreAuthorize
3. 请求的参数 @PathVariable @RequestParam @RequestBody
4. 异常的处理 @ControllerAdvice(全局处理) @ExceptionHandler(局部方法)
5. 返回的数据 ResponseEntity<Object> 携带Response Codes
