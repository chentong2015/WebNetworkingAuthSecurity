TODO. Client Pull
1. Short polling:
Client periodically requests a server for updates
发送请求，server端返回指定的response之后，确定关闭

2. Long polling:
The long polling request can timeout or can receive a disconnect from the server,
in that case, the client has to open a new request.
Server does not respond immediately. It waits until something changes, then responds update.
发送请求，在等到更新之前不关闭连接，如果在timeout时间内没有更新，发送特殊的Response

TODO. Server Push: Server-Sent Event (SSE)
A server proactively sends messages to clients immediately after they are available
Send text messages only from a server to clients in browser-based web.
