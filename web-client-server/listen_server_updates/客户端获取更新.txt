TODO. 客户端如何获取服务端数据更新 ?
Client Pull
- Client periodically requests a server for updates
- Short polling: 发送请求，server端返回指定的response之后，确定关闭
- Long polling: 发送请求，在等到更新之前不关闭连接，如果在timeout时间内没有更新，发送特殊的Response
  The long polling request can timeout or can receive a disconnect from the server,
  in that case, the client has to open a new request.

Server Push:
A server proactively sends messages to clients immediately after they are available
- Server-Sent Events:
  Send text messages only from a server to clients in browser-based web
- WebSocket:
  Simultaneous, bi-directional, real-time communication in web app
  based on a protocol other than HTTP(proxy servers, NATs, firewalls, etc)
  Allow both the server and the client to push messages at any time
  without any relation to a previous request.
