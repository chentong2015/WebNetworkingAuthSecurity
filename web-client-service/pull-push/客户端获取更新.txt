TODO. Client Pull
Short polling:
 发送请求，server端返回指定的response之后，确定关闭
 Client periodically requests a server for updates

Long polling:
 发送请求，在等到更新之前不关闭连接，如果在timeout时间内没有更新，发送特殊的Response
 The long polling request can timeout or can receive a disconnect from the server,
 in that case, the client has to open a new request.

TODO. Server Push
Server-Sent Events:
 A server proactively sends messages to clients immediately after they are available
 Send text messages only from a server to clients in browser-based web

TODO. WebSocket: 双端实时通讯
Simultaneous, bi-directional, real-time communication in web app
based on a protocol other than HTTP(proxy servers, NATs, firewalls, etc)
Allow both the server and the client to push messages at any time
without any relation to a previous request.
